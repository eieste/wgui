====================
Frontend Development
====================

The frontend uses tailwind for css Design.

but since this is a very simple interface it was decided not to use node js.

To create the tailwind css you need to download the tailwind binary

https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss/releases

then the CSS can be generated with the following command

.. code-block:: bash

   wgui:/$ tailwindcss -i src/css/tailwind.css -o wgui/static/css/tailwind.css --watch
